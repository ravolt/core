# Hammers encapsulate the concept of being able to
# perform actions on a node outside the context of the noderole
# graph.  Exmaples of these actions include:
# * Copying files to and from the system.
# * Executing a command on the system as someone with
#   admin rights.
# * Powering a system up or down.
# * Changing the boot target of a system.
# * Any other node management task that does not belong on the
#   node role graph.
